<h1>
    Execution Context
</h1>
<p>
    <h3>All JavaScript code needs to be hosted and run in some kind of environment. In most cases, that environment would be a web browser.</h3>
    <h4> JavaScript code to be executed in a web browser, a lot of processes take place behind the scenes</h4>
    <h2>There are some prerequisites:-</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Parser:</b> Parser or Syntax Parser is a program that reads your code line-by-line. It understands how the code fits the syntax defined by the Programming Language and what it (the code) is expected to do.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript Engine:</b> JavaScript engine is simply a computer program that receives JavaScript source code and compiles it to the binary instructions (machine code) that a CPU can understand. JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and each major browser has one. Examples include the V8 engine for Google chrome, SpiderMonkey for Firefox, and Chakra for Internet Explorer.
        </li>
        <li><b>Function Declaration:</b>These are functions that are assigned a name.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Example:-function doSomething() { //here "doSomething" is the function's name
statements;  -->
<li>
    <b>Function Expression</b>These are anonymous functions, that is functions without a function name like js function () { statements }. They are usually used in statements, like assigning a function to a variable. let someValue = function () { statements }.
</li>
<h2>How JavaScript Code Gets Executed</h2>
Browser doesn't know the highlevel javascript code that we write in our application.It needs convert in browser understandable language-Machine Code. <br>
While reading through HTML, if the browser encounters JavaScript code to run via a <.script.> tag or an attribute that contains JavaScript code like onClick, it sends it to its JavaScript engine.
<br><br>
The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
<br>
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution.
<br><br>
During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
<h2>There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:</h2>
<ul><li>Global Execution Context (GEC)</li>
<li>Global Execution Context (GEC)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Global Execution Context (GEC)</h2><br>
Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC). <br>
The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript code that is <b> not inside of a function </b> executed.
<h2>Function Execution Context</h2> <br>
Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.
<br>
Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.
<br>
<h2>How are Execution Contexts Created?</h2>
<h3>The different types available of Execution Context created:-</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Creation Phase</li>
    <li>Execution Phase</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creation Phase</h2> <br>
The Execution Context is first associated with an Execution Context Object (ECO). The Execution Context Object stores a lot of important data which the code in the Execution Context uses during its run-time. <br>
The creation phase occurs in 3 stages, during which the properties of the Execution Context Object are defined and set. These stages are:
<ol>
    <li>Creation of the Variable Object (VO)</li>
    <li>Creation of the Scope Chain</li>
    <li>Creation of the Scope Chain</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creation of the Variable Object (VO)</h2> <br>
The Variable Object (VO) is an object-like container created within an Execution Context. It stores the variables and function declarations defined within that Execution Context. <br>

In the GEC, for each variable declared with the var keyword, a property is added to VO that points to that variable and is set to 'undefined'. <br>

Also, for every function declaration, a property is added to the VO, pointing to that function, and that property is stored in memory. This means that all the function declarations will be stored and made accessible inside the VO, even before the code starts running. <br>

The FEC, on the other hand, does not construct a VO. Rather, it generates an array-like object called the 'argument' object, which includes all of the arguments supplied to the function. Learn more about the argument object here. <br>

This process of storing variables and function declaration in memory prior to the execution of the code is known as Hoisting. Since this is an important concept, we'll talk about it briefly before moving on to the next stage.
<h2>Hoisting in JavaScript</h2>
Function and variable declarations are hoisted in JavaScript. This means that they are stored in memory of the current Execution Context's VO and made available within the Execution Context even before the execution of the code begins. <br>
<h2>Function Hoisting</h2>
In most scenarios when building an application, developers can choose to define functions at the top of a script, and only later call them down the code, like so:
<h2>Variable Hoisting</h2>
Variables initialized with the var keyword are stored in the memory of the current Execution Context's VO as a property, and initialized with the value undefined. This means, unlike functions, trying to access the value of the variable before it is defined will result in undefined. <br>
<h2>Ground Rules of Hoisting</h2><br>
Hoisting only works for function declarations, not expressions. Here is an example of a function expression where the code execution will break.
<br><br>
The code execution breaks, because with function expressions, getAge will be hoisted as a variable not as a function. And with variable hoisting, its value will be set to undefined. <br> <br>
variable hoisting does not work for variables initialized with the let or const keyword. Trying to access a variable ahead of declaration and use the let and const keywords to declare it later will result in a ReferenceError <br> <br>
In this case, they will be hoisted but not assigned with the default value of undefined. js console.log(name); let name = "Victor"; will throw the error: <br>
<h2>Creation Phase: Creation of The Scope Chain:-</h2>
After the creation of the Variable Object (VO) comes the creation of the Scope Chain as the next stage in the creation phase of an Execution Context. <br>
Scope in JavaScript is a mechanism that determines how accessible a piece of code is to other parts of the codebase. Scope answers the questions: from where can a piece of code be accessed? From where can't it be accessed? What can access it, and what can't?<br><br>

Each Function Execution Context creates its scope: the space/environment where the variables and functions it defined can be accessed via a process called Scoping. <br>

This means the position of something within a codebase, that is, where a piece of code is located. <br>

When a function is defined in another function, the inner function has access to the code defined in that of the outer function, and that of its parents. This behavior is called lexical scoping.
 <br>
However, the outer function does not have access to the code within the inner function. <br>

This concept of scope brings up an associate phenomenon in JavaScript called closures. These are when inner functions that always get access to the code associated with the outer functions, even after the execution of the outer functions is complete. <br>

<h2> Creation Phase: Setting The Value of The "this" Keyword </h2>
The next and final stage after scoping in the creation phase of an Execution Context is setting the value of the this keyword. <br>

The JavaScript this keyword refers to the scope where an Execution Context belongs.
<br>
Once the scope chain is created, the value of 'this' is initialized by the JS engine. <br>

"this" in The Global Context <br>
In the GEC (outside of any function and object), this refers to the global object — which is the window object.
<br>
Thus, function declarations and variables initialized with the var keyword get assigned as properties and methods to the global object – window object. <br>
This means that declaring variables and functions outside of any function, like this:
<br>
<!--EXample  var occupation = "Frontend Developer"; 

function addOne(x) { 
    console.log(x + 1) 
} -->
<h2>The Execution Phase</h2> <br>
Finally, right after the creation phase of an Execution Context comes the execution phase. This is the stage where the actual code execution begins. <br>

Up until this point, the VO contained variables with the values of undefined. If the code is run at this point it is bound to return errors, as we can't work with undefined values. <br>

At this stage, the JavaScript engine reads the code in the current Execution Context once more, then updates the VO with the actual values of these variables. Then the code is parsed by a parser, gets transpired to executable byte code, and finally gets executed. <br>

 <h2>JavaScript Execution Stack </h2> <br>
The Execution Stack, also known as the Call Stack, keeps track of all the Execution Contexts created during the life cycle of a script.
<br>
JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it is capable of only executing a single task at a time. Thus, when other actions, functions, and events occur, an Execution Context is created for each of these events. Due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript, a stack of piled-up execution contexts to be executed is created, known as the Execution Stack.
<br>
When scripts load in the browser, the Global context is created as the default context where the JS engine starts executing code and is placed at the bottom of the execution stack.
<br>
The JS engine then searches for function calls in the code. For each function call, a new FEC is created for that function and is placed on top of the currently executing Execution Context.
<br>
The Execution Context at the top of the Execution stack becomes the active Execution Context, and will always get executed first by the JS engine.
<br>
As soon as the execution of all the code within the active Execution Context is done, the JS engine pops out that particular function's Execution Context of the execution stack, moves towards the next below it, and so on.
<br>
To understand the working process of the execution stack, consider the code example below:
<br>
<!-- Example var name = "Victor";

function first() {
  var a = "Hi!";
  second();
  console.log(`${a} ${name}`);
}

function second() {
  var b = "Hey!";
  third();
  console.log(`${b} ${name}`);
}

function third() {
  var c = "Hello!";
  console.log(`${c} ${name}`);
} first(); -->

 <br>
First, the script is loaded into the JS engine.
<br>
After it, the JS engine creates the GEC and places it at the base of the execution stack.
<br>

The name variable is defined outside of any function, so it is in the GEC and stored in it's VO.
<br>
The same process occurs for the first, second, and third functions.
<br>
Don't get confused as to why they functions are still in the GEC. Remember, the GEC is only for JavaScript code (variables and functions) that are not inside of any function. Because they were not defined within any function, the function declarations are in the GEC. Make sense now 😃?
<br>
When the JS engine encounters the first function call, a new FEC is created for it. This new context is placed on top of the current context, forming the so-called Execution Stack.
<br>

For the duration of the first function call, its Execution Context becomes the active context where JavaScript code is first executed.
<br>
In the first function the variable a = 'Hi!' gets stored in its FEC, not in the GEC.
<br>
Next, the second function is called within the first function.
<br>
The execution of the first function will be paused due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript. It has to wait until its execution, that is the second function, is complete.
<br>
Again the JS engine sets up a new FEC for the second function and places it at the top of the stack, making it the active context. <br>

The second function becomes the active context, the variable b = 'Hey!'; gets store in its FEC, and the third function is invoked within the second function. Its FEC is created and put on top of the execution stack.
<br>

Inside of the third function the variable c = 'Hello!' gets stored in its FEC and the message Hello! Victor gets logged to the console.
<br>

Hence the function has performed all its tasks and we say it returns. Its FEC gets removed from the top of the stack and the FEC of the second function which called the third function gets back to being the active context.
<br>
Back in the second function, the message Hey! Victor gets logged to the console. The function completes its task, returns, and its Execution Context gets popped off the call stack.
<br>

When the first function gets executed completely, the execution stack of the first function popped out from the stack. Hence, the control reaches back to the GEC of the code.
<br>

And lastly, when the execution of the entire code gets completed, the JS engine removes the GEC from the current stack.
<br>
<h2>Global Execution Context VS. Function Execution Context in JavaScript</h2>
Since you've read all the way until this section, let's summarize the key points between the GEC and the FEC with the table below. <br>
